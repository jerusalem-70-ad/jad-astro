# JÂ·AD 70

**JÂ·AD 70** is an application designed in connection with the project '[Medieval Reception of the Roman Conquest of Jerusalem](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/research/dh-research-infrastructure/activities/data-management-preservation/jad)'. This project examines the medieval reception and interpretation of the Roman conquest of Jerusalem in 70 AD by the emperors Titus and Vespasian, which ended a Jewish revolt and destroyed the Jewish Temple.

Astro automatically maps `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory to routes. For example, `index.astro` maps to `/`, and `manuscripts/index.astro` maps to `/manuscripts/`.

### Advanced Search
The advanced search functionality allows users to explore data in a detailed manner. It integrates custom logic for filtering and sorting based on JSON data.
